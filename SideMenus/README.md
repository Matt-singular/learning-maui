# SideMenus
This project focuses on learning the ins-and-outs of the side-menu `FlyoutItem`.

## Focus files
- **AppShell.xaml.cs** - Creation of the `FlyoutItem` components programmatically as well as auto-navigation to a specific route
- **StartupPage.xaml** - A helper page that is used as a 'startup' page, clicking the button will change the side menu upon clicking the button.
- **StartupPage.xaml.cs** - The code-behind logic that re-initialises the `AppShell`.
